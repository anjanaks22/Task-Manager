# Task-Manager
The Task Manager Website is a personal task management application designed to help users organize and track their daily tasks efficiently. Each user has their own secure sign-up and login, ensuring privacy and a personalized experience. Users can add tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority level, making it easy to keep track of important activities.

The application provides smart filtering options, allowing users to view tasks based on their status (Completed or Pending) and sort them by newest, oldest, or priority level. To ensure tasks are never forgotten, the app sends daily reminders for pending tasks, helping users stay on top of their schedules. Additionally, users can edit or delete tasks as needed, making task management seamless and efficient.

Built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, this task manager ensures a smooth and responsive experience with secure authentication and an intuitive UI. Whether for personal productivity or daily planning, this application serves as a reliable tool to manage and prioritize tasks effectively.
